# Your awesome TODO App

## Preparing for the task

This is a template repo, you need to use to create your own repo based on that,
and you need to invite your team mates.

Follow the instructions from the [prepare.md](./prepare.md)

Using your favorite Git visualization tool like
[Git Graph](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mhutchie.git-graph) 
can be useful.

If you got stuck with working with git branches, feel free to
check the [git-cheatsheet.md](./git-cheatsheet.md) for help.
